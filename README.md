## About Me

I'm a technical professional with a B.S. in Computer Engineering from the University of Virginia who has experience developing templates and guides for both technical and non-technical SaaS users. I've created this sample portfolio to showcase my technical documentation style.

## Writing Samples

### 1. [AI Tools for Code Documentation - Comparison Guide](./samples/ai-tools-comparison/)
**Type:** Reference documentation, comparison matrix  
**Audience:** Python developers, DevOps engineers  
**Skills demonstrated:**
- Tool comparison and evaluation
- Technical accuracy with code examples
- Clear decision-making frameworks
- Cost analysis and practical recommendations

[More samples coming soon]

## Documentation Philosophy

I believe effective technical documentation should be:
- **Accurate:** Technically precise with tested code examples when applicable
- **Accessible:** Appropriate for the target audience's knowledge level
- **Scannable:** Structure supports both deep reading and quick reference

*This portfolio demonstrates writing samples created for evaluation purposes. All code examples are original work.*
